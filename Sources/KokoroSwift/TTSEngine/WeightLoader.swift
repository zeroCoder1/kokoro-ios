/// - Filtering out unnecessary weights (e.g., position_ids)
/// - Transposing weight tensors for specific layers
/// - Validating and processing weight shapes
///
/// The class processes weights for different model components:
/// - BERT encoder weights
/// - Predictor (duration and prosody) weights
/// - Text encoder weights
/// - Decoder weights
